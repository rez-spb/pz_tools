# pz_tools
## Summary
Custom tools for Project Zomboid.

## Description
These are mostly self-written pieces of code in whatever language available at the moment.  
Each tool has its own directory in the repository, own sources root and documentation. Be sure to check them first.  
Tools are intended mostly for personal use, but feel free to try them out, comment and submit pull requests.

## Versioning and changelog
As this repository is mostly a collection of scripts, proper versioning is almost impossible without excessive 
complexity. Thus, changelogs will be provided on a script-by-script basis.  
Please refer to `docs/history.txt` file in a corresponding directory for a changelog for a given script.
